# tm
Here will be Android library to execute taks with 146% warranty that tasks will be executed.
Sometimes it's really nice to have engine which will guarantee task execution.
For example you have some app interacting with web-service, user is doing some actions: making order, capturing photo. All data should be posted to the server, TM is providing primitives that could be applied for generic operations, with retry in case of fail scenario. Keep tuned
