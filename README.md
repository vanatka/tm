# tm
Here will be Android library for execution 146% executed tasks.
Sometimes it's really nice to have engine which will guarantee task execution.
For example you have some app interacting with web-service, user is doing some actions: making order, capturing photo. All data should be posted to the server, TM is providing primitives that could be applied for generic operations, with retry in case of fail scenario. Keep tuned
